# Cracking-The-Coding-Interview

## Description
A set of problems and my solutions to them from the book Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell

## Motivation
I have two main reasons for making this repository.
- To sharpen my programming knowledge and learn some of the core concepts that are shown in the book.
- To provide A useful reference for both myself and anyone else wanting to learn about these concepts.

## Methodology
I went about solving these problems in a specific way. I first typed out the problem in question and then
wrote down the steps I would take to solve that problem, along with pseudo code to accompany it.

I then wrote out test cases for the problems to help enforce understanding of each problem at hand, as well
as understand exactly what it was I wanted the solution to return me.

Only after these steps did I begin coding the actual solution to the problem.

## Contents
In each folder there are a handful of problems from the chapter relating to the folder, each of them starts with
A comment describing the problem and the steps to take to get a solution. Note that these solutions are not always the
most efficient ways to solve these problems, just the ways that I thought of or could understand on my own. The point
of this repo is not to have all of the most elegant solutions, but to understand the core concept of the problem solutions
and the problems themselves.
